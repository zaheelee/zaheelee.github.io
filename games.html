          <p>
          	In this Choose Your Own Adventure, enter the mind of a sleepy college senior who needs to complete 
          	one final Photography 101 project in order to graduate on time. Travel through the unique streets of 
          	San Francisco, photographing all of the strange and interesting animals you see there to appease your 
          	professor and get an A. Just remember, do anything you can to get a good photo, and don't drop your camera!

          <h2>Resident Medieval</h2>
          <p>
          	Over the course of 6 weeks, my team of 10 Programmers and 4 Psychology students were tasked with creating a game 
          	that would use types of exposure therapy to assist players with overcoming their real world social anxiety.
          	It was the first time any of the programmers had worked on a game, and the first time the Psychology students had
          	written a gameplay script. 
          </p>
          <p>
          	Resident Medieval represents an amazing learning experience for every Programmer involved. 
          	Almost everyone on my team went on to take the Advanced Game Design course offered at CWRU, where their skills
          	improved along with the quality of their games. I also learned a lot from this game, as it taught me how to manage 
          	a team of Game Designers, Gameplay Programmers, and Writers.

          <h2>CUBE</h2>
          <p>
          	CUBE was the first game I ever made. This project served as my introduction to Unity development and solidified
          	my love for making games.
